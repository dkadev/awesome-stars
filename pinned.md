# Pinned Awesome Stars

> Pinned projects that I use frequently. This list is updated manually. Based on checking and testing the projects from the other lists.

I am always saving interesting projects and tools, this repo auto-deploys and keeps a large list but, I periodically do a cleanup through this method.

Methodology:

1. Star a repo at any time we cross paths.
2. Add it to a Github Star list (first categorizing).
3. Test it someday.
4. Choose:
    - Loved it? 😍 --> add it to the pinned list
    - It's not useful at all --> remove the star
    - Not using it soon but want to keep it --> do nothing
